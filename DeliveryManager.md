#Delivery Roles

##Delivery Manager

> I provide sound, reasoned governance that meets the needs of my customers while remaining flexible enough to get things done.

###I am a respected leader of people

I use my soft skills to bring out the best in both our people and our customers and encourage them to grow.

I know when and how to apply different coaching and mentoring techniques, understanding the maturity level of those I'm helping.

I am a good sounding-board and proactively broaden the perspective of teams and individuals with whom I'm working.

###I value clear, transparent and timely communication, and understand its role in the successful delivery of a project

I actively establish communications based on an agreed cadence, and continue them through to the closure of delivery.

I'm not afraid to have difficult conversations when needed, and do so with tact and care.

###I am able to balance Readify's commercial needs with return on investment needs of our customers

I am confident handling situations where we have made mistakes and working towards outcomes that are acceptable to both the customer and Readify.

I understand how budgeting, competition, strategic alignment and compliance pressures can influence project and program decisions and am able to adjust proposed delivery approaches based on those factors.

###I am able to identify and manage risk appropriately 

I know how to identify potential issues and will take action to head them off before they eventuate, whether they be technical, requirements or people based.

I am able to assess and identify risks in proposed delivery models, illustrate how these might impact our delivery if realised and collaborate to build appropriate mitigations.

###My investment back into Readify is a significant part of our success.

I take time to reflect on our identity, our people and our culture as Readify, and the way in which we work and how we deliver our engagements. 

I think of ways in which we can improve ourselves, engage others to validate those ideas and then invest time in implementing them.
