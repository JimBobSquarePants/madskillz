# Consulting Roles - Engineering Branch

These roles start after Senior Developer, as a more technically-focused career path.

Being technical does not eliminate the need to utilise soft skills, as you will still be dealing with people and need to be able to explain concepts across all levels of a business as well as at various events.  

## Senior Engineer
> I am a consultant with a specific technical speciality, an architect, and a communicator and a problem solver. I am the go-to person in my technology area and am known outside of Readify for it. I represent the technical brilliance that Readify brings to the market.

#### I am broader than my specialisation and more than a Senior Developer
- I have a wide understanding of software development technology and practices, backed by extensive practical experience.
- I am confident making architectural decisions taking concerns like infrastructure, identity management, security, scalability, performance, concurrency and maintainability into consideration.
- I am comfortable with transparently assessing risk, making recommendations, escalating appropriately and dealing with the consequences along the way.
- I can apply my technical abilities to productively solve business problems outside of my specialisation area with confidence and pragmatism.
- I am comfortable with building a product vision with a customer based on their business needs, regardless of whether this involves technology or otherwise.
- I have the skillz, speed and knowledge that enables me to consitently be one of the most productive team members of any team I am part of.
- I understand that while my specialisation may be a hammer in my toolkit, not every problem is a nail. I know when to propose alternate solutions that can solve the business need without using my deeply specialised skills.

#### I communicate technical concepts confidently and clearly
- I have developed strong presentation skills and am able to tailor my content and conversation to the audience.
- I am able to talk confidently about alternative solutions in my specialisation area. I can position the pros and cons of those solutions in terms of business costs and benefits rather than technical purity.
- I am able to solve deeply complex technical problems using my specialist skillz creating highly maintainable software. I can communicate the design of these solutions to others in a way that they can grasp and understand.
- I can confidently position ideas and solutions to problems and influence my team and my customer's decisions.

#### I am always learning, always teaching, always collaborating
- I am constantly looking for opportunities and ways to impart my knowledge to others.
- I may be a highly regarded engineer but I don't know everything, even when my ego wants to pretend I do. I am comfortable showing that I still need to learn and will visibly collaborate, seek help, get advice, and undertake mentoring as needed.
- I am an information sponge, always staying abreast of advances in both my specialty area and the broader sofwtare development ecosystem.
- I know that my knowledge will soon be obsolete so I'm actively investing in at least one other area or technology into which I can grow and specialise.
- I am proficient at delivering software products using agile practices.
